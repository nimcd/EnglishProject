	<p>Meriam Webster dictionary defines love as a warm attachment, enthusiasm, or devotion. But love cannot be defined through words. Only through a person’s actions can a definition of love be formed. In both <u>A Tale of Two Cities </u>by Charles Dickens and <u>The Kite Runner</u> by Khaled Hosseini the authors explore the meaning of love. Dickens and Hosseini believe that love can cause people to do things that conflict logic and make people do things that they normally wouldn’t do. Both authors utilize fully-developed, dynamic characters to prove their meaning of love.</p>
	<p>Both Dickens and Hosseini explain this theme in similar ways. Both books have many small characters who sacrifice for because of love throughout the story. However, these sacrifices are smaller and will not be noticed as significant by the reader until the end of the book. This is because at the end of the book, the main plot line ends with an unbelievable sacrifice. <u>In Tale of Two Cities</u> this sacrifice is made by Sydney Carton for Lucie while in <u>The Kite Runner</u> this sacrifice is made by Amir for Hassan and Sohrab.</p>
	<p>The  authors’ theme of love is demonstrated throughout the entire book in small ways but is not clearly defined until the very end of the book. When Sydney Carton chooses to die for Lucie Manette and “a life you love” he leaves behind everything in his life so that she can continue to live with her husband. He does this because he loves Lucie and wants her to continue to live a happy life. This is similar to <u>The Kite Runner </u>where Amir returns to his hometown in Afghanistan due to his love for Hassan. This proves the impact that love can have on a person and their happiness because both Amir and Carton have been living a hollow life of disapointments but once they make this sacrifice they are happy again.</p>
	<p>Although the power of love is most present at the end of<u> A Tale of Two Cities</u>, Charles Dickens includes a myriad of characters who are drawn to love including Charles Darnay and Madame Defarge. Charles Darnay chooses to return to France after many years even though he knows that his family is detested in France. Normally this would be completely illogical but the reason Darnay returns to France is because he loves his home country. Charles Darnay leaves his wife just to fight for a place where most of the people hate him and his family due to love. This proves that love is extremely powerful because it is powerful enough to make a man leave his family behind. In addition to Charles Darnay, Dickens portrays Madame Defarge as a symbol of the power of love. Madame Defarge leads the Jacques because she also loves France and does not want to see France be dominated by the upper class. She lives a pretty good life with her wine shop but gives it up for the betterment of France: the nation that she loves. Therefore, Madame Defarge’s decisions are determined by her love for France throughout the story.</p> 
	<p>Khaled Hosseini also demonstrates the power of love through the motivations of his minor characters. Everything Baba does is motivated by his love of Amir and Hassan. When he fixes Hassan’s lip he does so out of love even though this is different from the normal culture of Afghanistan. Normally Hazaras and Pashtuns are supposed to have specific roles and not work together. Baba believes that this tradition is very important to the culture in Afghanistan. However, because Baba loves Hassan he breaks the tradition that he believes is special to Afghanistan and pays for his lip to be fixed. Therefore, Baba is motivated to do this out of love for Hassan.This demonstrates Hosseini’s theme of the power of love because it shows that people will break traditions that they hold dear to them out of love. Another example of when Baba is motivated by the power of love is when he moves to America for Amir. Many times Amir comments that Baba is not happy in America and wants to go back to his homeland; Baba never returns to Afghanistan. Baba only stays in America to make Amir happy. This large sacrifice demonstrates Baba’s love for Amir because it explains that Baba will do anything to support Amir’s dream; this is Hosseini’s definition of love. Through Baba’s motivations throughout <u>The Kite Runner</u> Hosseini explains that love is when you would make any sacrifice for the person you love.</p>
	<p>Both authors connect love and sacrifice in similar ways. Dickens explains the power that love can have through characters’ motivations to act in the French Revolution. Hosseini expresses this same theme through the relationships Baba and his children have with each other. Love cannot be definied by soley a definition. In order to truly understand love one needs to feel love for another person and be willing to sacrifice anything for that person as characters do in <u>A Tale of Two Cities </u>and <u>The Kite Runner</u>.</p>
